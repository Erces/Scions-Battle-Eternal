# Scions-Battle-Eternal

  I worked on **Scions: Battle Eternal** while I worked at **"Project Flying Cat"**. I can't share any codes from that project due to it is not my own project I worked at under a company. Mainly **I did** the game mechanic codes like quest system, minimap system, random map generator etc. . There is a **playable demo on steam**.

- ABOUT THIS GAME

Scions: Battle Eternal is a skill-based action rogue-like game featuring a unique world with variously themed areas and multiple playing characters with different talents and skill sets to choose from. The aim is to navigate through random-generated levels to enhance and strengthen the player character by accumulating experience at each run and unlocking character-specific spells, weapons, talents, and abilities by allocating experience points. The players can differentiate each character by combining the various spells, weapons, talents, and abilities according to their preferences and play style.
Scions: Battle Eternal is a challenging and rewarding game that offers players a unique blend of action and strategy. The randomly generated levels ensure that no two playthroughs are the same, and the variety of characters and abilities allows players to create a play style that is truly their own.

Scions are those whose souls are harvested after their death by the elders to be evolved into a weapon of destruction.
As a Scion, your aim is to endure/defeat as many enemies as possible to gather gold & souls to evolve and level up your character while unlocking new enemies, Scions, and maps. As you progress, you can combine multiple skills to create new ones and mow down your adversaries with ease!
